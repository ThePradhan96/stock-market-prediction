the implementation of a Markov Model to predict stock market performance, focusing on major IT stocks in India. The project evaluates the potential of stocks from Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro, and HCL by analyzing their historical closing prices and applying the Markov Chain to forecast future states.
1. **Data Collection**: Historical closing prices of the stocks are collected.
2. **State Classification**: Closing prices are categorized into three states:
   - Bull: Prices rising
   - Bear: Prices falling
   - Stagnant: Prices unchanged
3. **Model Implementation**: Markov Model is used to calculate state transition probabilities and forecast future states.
4. **Prediction**: Future state probabilities for the next three months are calculated.
